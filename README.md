# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
The intention of this project was to look at several thousand crowdfunding projects to identify any trends. Through organization, sorting, and analyzing crowdfunding data we were able to determine if specific factors make a projectâ€™s campaign more successful. 

Findings:

Displayed below is the goal and amount raised for each play. This visual shows the results in percentages. The percentages in this column change from red to blue as the percentage of completion increases. Also included in this data sample is the count of backers each campaign obtained. As you can see, fewer backers and higher goals resulted in lower percentage of completion.

Conversely, the same was found to be true when there was a higher number of backers and lower benchmarks set for goals. This combination resulted in an increase in the percentage of completion.

Pivot tables were included along with charts to visualize the count of failed, live, and successful plays filtered by country. The example below shows Great Britain had a total count of 314 plays. Of these 70 failed, 6 are live, and 238 were successful. This is a great visual measure to determine which geographic areas perform better than others.

The graph below shows a measure success rate based on the month in which the campaign was launched. The data suggests May to August is the highest performing timeframe with May being the most successful. On the contrary, December displays the biggest dip in success and a rise in campaign failure.

The measures of central tendency took us on a deep dive into the kick starters in the United States, both successful and unsuccessful. This gave us a measure of our mean and median goal of each, or a snapshot of where our average goal sits as well as the middle ground of our data. Obtaining this knowledge helps us to gain insight in deciding where to set the bar for future fundraising projects. The data was drilled down further to show the statistics of the data. We included the measures of spread including standard deviation, upper and lower quartiles, and the interquartile range (IQR).

In summation, in order to have a successful fundraising campaign a few elements need to be taken into consideration. The time in which you launch the campaign has proven to affect the data. May would be your best month to do this. The number of backers and where the financial benchmark is set has a great impact on the success of meeting your goal. The data suggests for a crowdfunding goal of $10,000.00, a minimum number of backers of 75 with an average donation per backer of $138.00 is recommended.
